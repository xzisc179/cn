✅ 1. VLAN — Virtual Local Area Network

Full Form: Virtual Local Area Network
Layer: Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)

Explanation:

A VLAN is a logical (virtual) segmentation of a physical network.
Even if devices are connected to the same switch, VLAN divides them into separate broadcast domains.

Why used?

Reduces broadcast traffic

Improves security

Allows grouping based on function, not location

Where it appears in your manual:

In the VLAN and VTP experiments (Lab Manual Snippet) 

cn manual


Shows how each VLAN gets its own broadcast domain.

✅ 2. VTP — VLAN Trunking Protocol

Full Form: VLAN Trunking Protocol
Layer: Layer 2

Explanation:

VTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol used to manage, add, modify, or delete VLANs across multiple switches automatically.

Why used?

Centralized VLAN management

Reduces configuration errors

Automatically propagates VLAN information to all switches in the VTP domain

Modes:

Server Mode: Create/modify VLANs

Client Mode: Cannot modify; only receives VLAN information

Transparent Mode: Forwards VTP messages but does not participate

VTP experiment demonstration in the manual (switch diagram)

✅ 3. STP — Spanning Tree Protocol

Full Form: Spanning Tree Protocol
Layer: Layer 2 (Switching)

Explanation:

STP prevents loops in a network that has multiple switches interconnected.
Switching loops can cause broadcast storms and MAC table instability.

How STP works:

Selects a Root Bridge

Calculates the shortest path

Blocks redundant ports to avoid loops

Reopens ports if needed (link failure)

Why used?

Prevents network loops

Provides redundancy without causing broadcast storms

Where it appears:

The manual’s switching experiment includes STP concepts (trunks, loops, VLANs)

✅ 4. TCP — Transmission Control Protocol

Full Form: Transmission Control Protocol
Layer: Transport Layer (Layer 4)

Explanation:

TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol used for guaranteed data delivery.

Key Features:

Connection established before communication

Uses 3-way handshake (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK)

Provides reliability (ACK, retransmission)

Ensures ordered data delivery

Why used?

When data accuracy is essential: file transfer, banking, login systems.

Where it appears:

Manual mentions three-way handshake (TCP process) .

✅ 5. HTTP — Hypertext Transfer Protocol

Full Form: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
Layer: Application Layer

Explanation:

HTTP is used to transfer web pages between client and server.
Operates on port 80.

Characteristics:

Stateless

Uses methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

Works over TCP

Where it appears:

In the Wireshark and packet analysis labs (HTTP packets on port 80).

✅ 6. DNS — Domain Name System

Full Form: Domain Name System
Layer: Application Layer

Explanation:

DNS converts domain names to IP addresses (example.com → 142.250.71.78).

Why needed?

Humans remember names, computers use IP.

Types of records:

A Record: domain → IPv4

AAAA: domain → IPv6

PTR: reverse lookup

MX: mail server

Where it appears:

DNS lookup and analysis practical in the manual.

✅ 7. DHCP — Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

Full Form: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
Layer: Application Layer (uses UDP 67/68)

Explanation:

Automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration to devices.

Process (DORA):

Discover

Offer

Request

Acknowledge

Why used?

Avoids manual IP configuration

Prevents conflicts

Where it appears:

DHCP configuration practical in the manual.

✅ 8. FTP — File Transfer Protocol

Full Form: File Transfer Protocol
Layer: Application Layer
Ports: 20 (data), 21 (control)

Explanation:

Protocol for transferring files between client and server.

Modes:

Active

Passive

Where it appears:

Manual mentions FTP when explaining server functionalities.

✅ 9. UDP — User Datagram Protocol

Full Form: User Datagram Protocol
Layer: Transport Layer

Explanation:

Connectionless, fast protocol without guarantee of delivery.

Used for:

Video streaming

VoIP

DNS queries

Why?

Speed is more important than reliability.

Where it appears:

UDP used in DNS + various application-layer examples in the manual
