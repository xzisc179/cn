6. Connect each PC to the switch using Copper Straight-Through cables:
   - Click on cable icon (lightning bolt)
   - Select Copper Straight-Through
   - Click on PC, select FastEthernet0
   - Click on Switch, select any available FastEthernet port
7. Configure IP addresses on each PC:

10 IMPORTANT VIVA QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q1. What is network topology?
A: Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of network
   devices and the interconnections between them. It defines how devices are
   connected and how data flows in the network.

Q2. What is the difference between physical and logical topology?
A: Physical topology is the actual physical arrangement of cables and devices.
   Logical topology is how data flows in the network regardless of physical
   arrangement. Example: A network may be physically star but logically bus.

Q3. Why do we use a switch in star topology instead of a hub?
A: Switches provide better performance by sending data only to the intended
   recipient (unicast), while hubs broadcast to all devices. Switches also
   support full-duplex communication and prevent collisions.

Q4. What is a single point of failure in star topology?
A: The central switch/hub is the single point of failure. If it fails, the
   entire network becomes non-functional. However, if one PC fails, others
   remain connected.

Q5. What cable types are used in Ethernet networks?
A: - Straight-Through: Connect different devices (PC-Switch, Switch-Router)
   - Cross-Over: Connect similar devices (PC-PC, Switch-Switch, Router-Router)
   - Console/Rollover: For device configuration
   - Fiber Optic: For long-distance, high-speed connections

Q6. What is the difference between UTP and STP cables?
A: UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair): No shielding, cheaper, susceptible to EMI
   STP (Shielded Twisted Pair): Has metallic shielding, expensive, better
   protection against electromagnetic interference

Q7. Why is mesh topology rarely used in LANs?
A: Mesh topology requires n(n-1)/2 connections for n devices, making it
   extremely expensive and complex to implement. It's mainly used in WANs
   and critical systems where redundancy is essential.

Q8. What is the maximum cable length for Cat5e/Cat6 Ethernet?
A: The maximum cable length for twisted pair Ethernet (Cat5e/Cat6) is 100
   meters (328 feet) for copper cables. Beyond this, signal degradation occurs.

Q9. What are the advantages of fiber optic cables over copper?
A: - Higher bandwidth and speed (up to 100 Gbps and beyond)
   - Longer distance (up to 40-100 km)
   - Immune to electromagnetic interference
   - More secure (difficult to tap)
   - Lighter weight
   Disadvantages: More expensive, fragile, requires special equipment

Q10. What is collision domain and broadcast domain?
A: Collision Domain: A network segment where data packets can collide. Hubs
    create one collision domain; switches separate collision domains.
    Broadcast Domain: A network segment where a broadcast frame is propagated.
    Switches forward broadcasts; routers separate broadcast domains.

================================================================================
PRACTICAL TIPS
================================================================================

1. Always check cable connections (green triangles = good connection)
2. Ensure IP addresses are in the same subnet for connectivity
3. Use Simulation mode to see packet flow
4. Save your work regularly
5. Label devices for better organization
6. Use ping command to verify connectivity
7. Check port status lights on devices

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This practical demonstrates the fundamental network topologies and helps
understand how different physical arrangements affect network performance,
reliability, and cost. Each topology has its specific use cases based on
requirements like cost, reliability, and scalability.
