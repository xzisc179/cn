A. PROCEDURE (Step-by-Step in Packet Tracer)
1. Create the Network Topology

Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

Add devices:

1 Server

1 Switch

2–4 PCs (Clients)

Connect all devices using Copper Straight-Through cables.


2. Configure DHCP on the Server
Step 1: Assign Static IP to Server

Click Server → Desktop → IP Configuration.

Set:

IP Address: 192.168.1.10

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 (you can choose any router IP; if no router, leave blank)

Note: DHCP server must always have a static IP

Step 2: Enable DHCP Service

Go to Services → DHCP on the Server.

Turn DHCP Service → ON.

Create a new DHCP Pool:

Pool Name: LAN1

Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

DNS Server: 192.168.1.10 (or 8.8.8.8)

Start IP Address: 192.168.1.20

Maximum Users: 100

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Click Save.

Now your DHCP server is ready


3. Configure Client PCs to Receive IP Automatically
For each PC:

Click PC → Desktop → IP Configuration.

Select DHCP option instead of Static.

The PC should automatically receive an IP such as:

IP Address: 192.168.1.x (from DHCP server)

Gateway: 192.168.1.1

DNS Server: 192.168.1.10


Verify DHCP Operation
Check on client PC:

IP address should appear automatically.

Try ping test:

PC > Command Prompt
ping 192.168.1.10    (Ping Server)
ping 192.168.1.1     (Ping Gateway)

If pings are successful → DHCP is working correctly.

B. VIVA QUESTIONS & ANSWERS (Oral Format)
1. What is DHCP?

DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It automatically assigns IP addresses and other network parameters to client devices.

2. Why do we use DHCP?

We use DHCP to reduce manual configuration, avoid IP conflicts, and simplify IP management.

3. What are the main components of a DHCP message?

DHCP Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledgement (DORA).

4. Why must the DHCP server have a static IP?

Because clients need a fixed and known server address to request IP configuration.

5. What is a DHCP pool?

A DHCP pool is a set of IP addresses that the server can assign to clients dynamically.

6. What is the default gateway in DHCP?

The gateway is the router address that allows the client to access other networks.

7. What happens if two DHCP servers exist in the same network?

Clients may receive IP from either server, which can result in incorrect configuration if not planned.

8. What is lease time?

Lease time is the duration for which a client can use the assigned IP.

9. How do clients request an IP address in DHCP?

Clients broadcast a DHCP Discover message on the network.

10. What is the difference between static and dynamic IP?

Static IP is manually configured and fixed. Dynamic IP is assigned automatically by DHCP
